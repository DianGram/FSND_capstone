# Feed the Kids

## Udacity Full Stack NanoDegree Capstone Project

### Overview
For my Capstone project, I am implementing an app for a non-profit called Feed the Kids.  
There are two tables: Tasks and Volunteers, and two roles:  Assistant and Director. Auth0 is used to authenticate users.
* The Assistant Role:
    *  Can view, create, and update Volunteers
    *  Can view and update Tasks

* The Director Role:
    * Can view, create, update and delete Volunteers
    * Can view, create, update and delete Tasks

* The public:
    * Can sign up, view, update and delete their own profile
    * Can view tasks
